# Honeypot Framework

Welcome to the Honeypot Framework! This project provides a versatile honeypot environment that emulates vulnerable services to attract and analyze potential attackers. The framework supports Kali Linux and follows ethical guidelines for research and education.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Kali Linux machine:

git clone <repository_url>
cd honeypot-framework


2. Install required dependencies using `pip`:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Configure the `config.yaml` file in the root directory to specify network settings and ports.

4. Start the honeypot by running the `honeypot.py` script:

python honeypot.py


5. (Optional) Start the web interface by running the `web_interface.py` script:

cd web_interface
python web_interface.py


## Usage

- **Emulation:** The honeypot framework emulates vulnerable services to attract attackers.

- **Capturing Data:** The framework captures data from incoming connections, simulating login attempts, exploit actions, and other attack behaviors.

- **Logging:** Attack data, including IP addresses, attack types, and data exchanged, is logged for analysis.

- **Categorization:** Attack data is categorized into types such as "Brute Force," "SQL Injection," and more.

- **Reporting:** Use the `attack_analysis.py` script to generate detailed reports about attack trends, categories, and individual incidents.

- **Web Interface (Optional):** Access the web-based dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` to visualize attack statistics and reports.

- **Database (Optional):** If enabled, store attack data in a SQLite database for structured querying and analysis.

- **Blacklisting and Whitelisting:** Manage access by blacklisting malicious IP addresses and whitelisting safe ones.

## Web Interface

If you've enabled the web interface using Flask, you can access the dashboard in your web browser. The interface provides:

- **Total Attacks:** See the total number of attacks on the dashboard, indicating how many times the honeypot has been targeted.

- **Attack Categories:** If implemented, view different attack categories (e.g., "Brute Force," "SQL Injection") and the corresponding number of attacks in each category.

- **Reports:** Generate detailed reports using the interface, displaying insights into attack trends and behaviors.

## Database

If you've opted to use the database functionality, the framework stores attack data securely and offers structured querying and analysis capabilities.

## Blacklisting and Whitelisting

Manage access to the honeypot by adding or removing IP addresses from the blacklist or whitelist.
